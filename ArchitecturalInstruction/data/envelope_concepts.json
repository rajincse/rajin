                    "description": "The use of materials for building construction causes major impacts on the environment, including significant water consumption and resource and energy usage as well as greenhouse gas emissions. These materials consume energy and water in their removal, manufacturing, transportation, maintenance and recycling and produce hazardous emissions during these processes. Approximate indicators of a material's environmental impact are embodied energy, embodied water and carbon footprint. Designing buildings with improved environmental performance should go beyond decreasing the operational energy and aim at reducing embodied energy, embodied water and carbon footprint during the life cycle of building materials."

Insulation materials can be either organic, which refers to raw materials such as cork, mineral fiber, cotton, etc., or inorganic, which refers to synthetic materials such as polyurethane rigid foam or polystyrene. Thermal insulation is used to reduce the rate of heat transfer through the building enclosure and protects against moisturerelated damage. Thermal insulation plays a critical role in the energy efficiency of buildings because it mitigates energy exchange between the interior of the building and the exterior environment. The thermal energy transfer through a material is dependent on its thermal conductivity. A material with less conductivity will have smaller energy exchange with the external environment, therefore creating a better insulation. In addition, materials with less density have a better insulation quality because they have higher air content. Air and some inert gases such as xenon, krypton and argon are good insulators and are often used as insulation between glass panels."

A number of newly developed materials can store energy without requiring a great mass. Because these materials are being further developed, tested and improved, their use in building construction is becoming more prevalent."
