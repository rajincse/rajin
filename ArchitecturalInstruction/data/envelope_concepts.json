These materials consume energy and water in their removal, manufacturing, transportation, maintenance and recycling and produce hazardous emissions during these processes. Approximate indicators of a material's environmental impact are embodied energy, embodied water and carbon footprint. Designing buildings with improved environmental performance should go beyond decreasing the operational energy and aim at reducing embodied energy, embodied water and carbon footprint during the life cycle of building materials."

								"title":"EMBODIED ENERGY", 
								"text":" Embodied energy is the amount of energy  used to extract, produce, and distribute a material to the location  of use. In general, the embodied energy of building materials con- tributes about 15 to 20 percent to the energy used by a building  over a 50-year period. 1  This percentage is expected to increase as  buildings become more energy efficient. The units for embodied  energy may be expressed as Mega Joules (MJ) or Btu per unit of  weight (kg or lb) or per unit area (square meter or square foot).  The embodied energy for an enclosure system can be arrived at  by the summation of the embodied energy values of each indi- vidual material used in the system or the assembly. Although the  use of different methodologies and data sets for calculating em- bodied energy can result in different measurements, these mea- surements still provide an indication of resource depletion and  energy utilization in the construction of a building.  The strategies and recommendations below provide a framework  for selecting materials and construction methods for the design of  building envelopes: * Investigate the embodied energy values of materials prior to  construction to select materials with lower embodied energy.  * When possible, use salvaged materials with high recycled con- tent to reduce embodied energy, construction waste and air pol- lution to save water. *When possible, use regional construction materials to decrease  the transportation distances in order to reduce embodied energy."

In addition to  the daily operation of buildings, water is used in the production of  building materials. The amount of water used to manufacture and  deliver materials to their final destination is called embodied water. There is a growing body of research using various methodolo- gies to estimate the embodied water values for various materials.  Based on a study conducted by the Royal Institute of Australian  Architects, there is a close relationship between embodied water  and embodied energy. As a result, the study concludes the strat- egies used to reduce the embodied energy will be effective for  reducing the embodied water in buildings."

When glass was first used in  architecture and construction, it had many limitations, including  cost and labor-intensive fabrication processes. Today, architec- tural glass has become a favored building material because it  is relatively inexpensive and it offers versatility. When utilized for  cladding purposes, glass has a profound impact in the aesthetics  and energy efficiency of a building. Glass can be reflective, refrac- tive, transparent, translucent and opaque. It can control glare as it  filters light and  can provide sound and fire protection. Glass has  been the focus of intensive research and development among  scientists and engineers to enhance its two most efficient traits,  the ability to transmit natural light and block excessive heat."

Insulation materials can be either organic, which refers to raw materials such as cork, mineral fiber, cotton, etc., or inorganic, which refers to synthetic materials such as polyurethane rigid foam or polystyrene. Thermal insulation is used to reduce the rate of heat transfer through the building enclosure and protects against moisturerelated damage. Thermal insulation plays a critical role in the energy efficiency of buildings because it mitigates energy exchange between the interior of the building and the exterior environment. The thermal energy transfer through a material is dependent on its thermal conductivity. A material with less conductivity will have smaller energy exchange with the external environment, therefore creating a better insulation. In addition, materials with less density have a better insulation quality because they have higher air content. Air and some inert gases such as xenon, krypton and argon are good insulators and are often used as insulation between glass panels."
