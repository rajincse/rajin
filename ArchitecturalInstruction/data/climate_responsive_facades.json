                    "description": "Double-skin facades are generally composed of two layers of glazing separated by an air cavity that performs as insulation against extreme temperatures. The exterior layer is usually composed of hardened single glazing that mediates climatic conditions to reduce the building's overall energy consumption. The interior layer is usually a double-glazed window that seals and insulates the building. The air cavity between the two layers of glazing can be totally natural, fan supported or mechanically ventilated. A double-skin facade can incorporate integrated sunshading devices, natural ventilation systems, and thermal, acoustical, and fire safety insulation materials. In general, there are three types of double-skin facades: the extract-air system, the buffer system, and the twin-face system. There are also hybrid double facades that include opaque, translucent or screen elements as an alternative to single glazing on the outer skin to control solar heat gains, glare, and daylighting levels."

Shading devices are often attached to the building's cladding frame or mounted directly to the building structure. They can be manually operated or automatically controlled by a building management system. External louvers generally consist of glass fins, perforated metal louvers, or wood slats utilized to control solar radiation and glare based on the facade orientation. Horizontal louvers are efficient in southern facades whereas vertical louvers respond effectively to the low summer sun striking the east and west facades, as well as sun in the higher latitudes on the northeast and northwest facades. When used in combination with double-skin facades, the shading devices can be incorporated into maintenance walkways attached or integrated in the facade cavity."

PV systems may be utilized as the external wall finishing or as part of the facade to provide shading. The optimum orientation and correct tilt angle of the PV installation are fundamental in the solar access and the potential electrical output of the system. Photovoltaic facades on the northern hemisphere should be oriented south and tilted at an angle 15 degrees higher than the site latitude for maximum efficiency."
