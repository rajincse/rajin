        "text":"The design and the technology used in exterior walls entail the use  of diverse materials. In general, wall systems can be designed as  a monolithic construction or a multi-layered system. In monolithic  wall construction, the protective insulation and the structural sys- tem are all integrated into the same layer. Multilayer walls carry  these functions in separate layers. The capacity of walls to func- tion as structural systems is dependent on the material and con- struction type. Walls can serve as the primary or secondary load- bearing structure, or not perform any structural function at all. The following sections will introduce a number of commonly  used wall types, their components, construction and assembly  methods, and their sustainability properties. Each wall will be ac- companied by tabulated property values for standard construc- tion as well as for green construction. The values listed for green construction are based on the use of alternative materials with  improved environmental performance"

							"text":"A cavity wall consists of two unbonded wythes of masonry separated by an air space. The primary purpose of the cavity is to prevent water from reaching the inner wythe. Cavity walls can be load bearing or nonload-bearing. For load-bearing constructions, the floor and roof loads of the building are carried by the inner wythe. For nonload-bearing assemblies, another primary structure such as steel or concrete carries roofs and floors. The cavity wall carries only its own weight."
						},
						{ 	"title":"INNER WYTHE",
							"text":"In load-bearing assemblies, the inner wythe is  structural. All floor and roof loads are transferred into the inner  wythe, which transmits those loads down to the foundations. The  inner wythe is typically made of concrete masonry units (CMUs)  and can vary in thickness. In load-bearing assemblies, several  thicknesses of block might be used in the same building, typi- cally 8-inch (20.2 cm) CMUs on upper floors and 12- or 16-inch  (30.5 - 40.6 cm) CMUs on lower floors, where accumulated loads  are greater.  The most commonly used device where floor and roof loads are  transferred into a CMU wall is a bond beam: U-shaped blocks  placed in a section without intermediate webs. The trough formed  is filled with steel reinforcement and grout, which ties the blocks  together to create what is effectively a reinforced concrete beam  embedded in the wall, making a strong bearing beam to transfer/ distribute floor and roof loads into the wall.  Masonry is strong in compression and effective in resisting gravity  loads, but has no strength in tension. To deal with wind loads,  which introduce tensile forces in walls, the cavity wall may require  reinforcing. This is typically accomplished by horizontal joint re- inforcement and/or vertical rebar grouted solid within the cells of  the CMU inner wythe. In nonload-bearing assemblies, the inner  wythe is an infill within another primary structure, such as a steel  or concrete frame. In this case, the inner wythe sits on the slab,and its weight is carried by the primary structure. Typically, the  outer face of the inner wythe is flushed with the edge of the slab to  ensure a continuous cavity."
						},
						{ 	"title":"OUTER WYTHE",
							"text":"The outer wythe of a cavity wall is nonstructural.  The primary functions of the outer wythe are to determine the ap- pearance of the wall, keep most liquid water out (not all), and  transfer lateral wind loads to the inner wythe through the cavity  ties. In small-scale construction, the outer wythe transmits its own load  directly down to the foundations. In larger-scale construction, the  outer wythe is typically carried by a shelf angle, which is bolted to  the edge of the floor slab. At each floor level, this angle transfers  the weight of the outer wythe to the primary structure. Ideally, the  shelf angle is stainless steel. Less costly galvanized steel angles  may be used, but these carry the risk of corrosion. The shelf an- gle, typically bolted to an insert cast into the edge of the slab, has  slotted holes for tolerance and leveling."
						},
						{ 	"title":"CAVITY",
							"text":"The role of the cavity is primarily to provide a capillary  break against water penetration. The secondary benefits are that  it allows for differential movement of the inner and outer wythes  and enhances the insulation value of the wall. The dimension of  the cavity varies depending on how much additional insulation  is placed within the cavity. As a rule of thumb, the cavity must  retain a minimum clear dimension of 2 inches (50 mm) to work  effectively. A narrower cavity is too easily bridged by mortar, which  can squeeze out of joints or drop down inside the cavity, or by  insulation, which has been unevenly placed. Any such bridging in  the cavity must be avoided because it provides a path for water to  pass into the inner wythe. "
						},
						{ 	"title":"CAVITY TIES",
							"text":"Because the two wythes of a cavity wall are not bond- ed, they must be connected by cavity ties, which are inserted in  the bed (horizontal) joints of both wythes at the spacing specified  by the manufacturer. Made of metal, plastic sheet or wire, cavity  ties are flexible and allow differential movement between wythes.  Because cavity ties must bridge the cavity, most are designed  with a drip detail to prevent the passage of water across the cav- ity. As the width of the cavity increases, cavity ties become more  expensive. The most durable and costly cavity ties are stainless  steel. Galvanized steel ties are less expensive, but carry the risk  of corrosion. "
						},
						{ 	"title":"INSULATION",
							"text":"The air space of the cavity itself contributes to  the insulation value of the wall. However, it is rarely sufficient to  provide the required level of thermal, acoustical, and fire safety  performance, so insulation is typically added to the assembly. A  common location for insulation is within the cavity, where it is fixed  to the outer face of the inner wythe. Because insulation within the  cavity will get wet from time to time, it is important to specify prod- ucts that will not degrade under wet conditions. Another location  for insulation systems are outside on the walls. They are called  exterior insulation and finish systems (EIFS). These systems are  added to bricks, concrete or other thermal mass materials to pro-vide a layer of continuous exterior insulation that protects from  temperature fluctuations and keeps interiors more comfortable.  In addition, by placing the insulation layer on the exterior of the  building, heat loss or heat transfer caused by thermal bridging is  reduced. 6  The thickness of insulation can be varied to enhance  the thermal performance of the wall. This improved performance  must be weighed against increased costs of insulation cavity ties  and flashings for thicker assemblies. However, higher first costs  for better insulation can also help to save energy with significant  pay back. "
						},
						{ 	"title":"VAPOR BARRIER",
							"text":" Although the outer wythe and the cavity prevent  the ingress of water in liquid form, a barrier is required to resist  the passage of water vapor through the wall. Vapor pressure al- ways seeks to equalize on both sides of a wall. Warm air has a  higher moisture content/vapor pressure than cool air, so vapor  will seek to move from warm to cool areas to equalize pressure.  As it does so, moisture-laden air cools and, if it reaches the dew  point, causes condensation problems within buildings. In general,  the vapor barrier is located on the warm side of the insulation to  prevent the moisture in warm air to cool and become condensate.  A vapor barrier is made of plastic or foil and can be a separate  membrane or, more commonly, an integral layer laminated to in- sulation. The vapor barrier may also be a liquid cementitious or  asphalt-based coating applied by brush."
						},
						{ 	"title":"INTERIOR FINISH",
							"text":"  If the inner face of the inner wythe is not to be  seen in the completed building, a finish is required. This might be  gypsum board (dry wall), wet plaster, tile/stone, or wood/metal  paneling. Typically, wood or metal furring strips/channels are  required. The furring strips are screwed to the inner wythe and  can be shimmed to provide a level surface. The finish is in turn  screwed to the furring strips. The space thus created (1-2 inches  or 2.5-5.1 cm) between the inner wythe and the finish may be  used for concealing pipes and electrical conduit and wiring."
						},
						{ 	"title":"FLASHINGS",
							"text":"A flashing is a continuous sheet of thin, impervious  material used as a barrier against the passage of water. There are  two broad categories: external flashings, which keep water out of  the cavity, and internal flashings, which take water from the cavity  and direct it out. Examples of locations where external flashings are required are at  the top of a wall or at the junction of a flat roof and a parapet wall.  External flashings are not always hidden, but might be exposed,  such as a sheet metal coping/flashing at the top of a wall or the  counter-flashing at a roof/wall junction. Internal flashings, which are also called cavity trays, are required  whenever anything interrupts, projects into, or bridges the cav- ity. The only exceptions are cavity ties, which do not need to be  flashed. Locations where internal flashings are required include  at floor levels where shelf angles are used to support the outer  wythe; at openings such as windows or doors, which must be  flashed at the top, the sides and at the sill; and at the base of a  wall where the cavity terminates. Instead of extending horizontally  through the wall, a cavity tray must be stepped 6-8 inches or 15.2- 20.3 cm down toward the outer wythe, so that any water in the  cavity is naturally directed down and out. "
						},
						{ 	"title":"CONSTRUCTION AND SUSTAINABILITY",
							"text":"The construction of a cavity wall  requires highly skilled labor. Because of the mortar, a cavity wall is  a form of wet construction, which is more time consuming and site  labor intensive than dry forms of construction, which can be pre- fabricated and more quickly assembled on-site. Cavity wall con- struction is weather dependent. In extremely hot weather, mortarhydrates too quickly, which reduces its strength. If temperatures  drop below freezing, mortar will not hydrate. Work must either be  delayed or heating within temporary enclosures provided to en- able work to continue. Masonry is a long-life material that requires  relatively little maintenance. The primary maintenance issue is  renewal of mortar pointing, which may be required at 50-year in- tervals."

This  malleability makes it cost effective and requires a moderate skill  level. In addition, the hollow cells can absorb a variety of building  complements and adapt to a wide range of structural capacities.  CMU walls are quite durable. Their weakness is porosity, therefore  waterproofing this building system requires special attention. If left unprotected, the CMUs can act like sponges and absorb a great  deal of water. In addition, because the CMU is an intensely site- built system, the assembly of a CMU wall is exposed to human  error and the realities of weather and site conditions.  Concrete is a tremendously energy-consumptive material. Al- though CMU blocks are made quickly, additional energy is re- quired to speed up the curing process. In spite of this, CMU walls  require little maintenance over time."

							"text":"Concrete is a mixture of water, Portland cement, ag- gregate and sand. Upon adding water, the mixture undergoes a  process of hydration (curing), which transforms the liquid mate- rial into a solid mass. This is not a drying process, rather it is a  process in which water combines with cement to form concrete.  Concrete has tremendous compressive strength, but very small  tensile strength. "

						{
							"title":"STEEL REINFORCEMENT",
							"text":" Steel reinforcement provides concrete with  tensile strength, allowing it to span distances without an arch form.  Standard reinforcing takes the form of hot-rolled steel bars. These  bars are ribbed to allow the steel to grip the surrounding concrete.  Steel reinforcement can also be in form of wires or strands and be  pulled in tension to squeeze concrete into compression to pro- duce more efficient spans. The tension force applied to strands  can occur before the concrete has cured (pretensioned) or after it  has cured (posttensioned). "

Typically, formwork is a temporary structure that  is assembled to support the weight of concrete while it cures and  is removed once the concrete has reached sufficient strength.  The inside of a formwork surface can be manipulated to produce  patterns, lines and reveals on the exterior of the finished concrete  wall. Due to the weight of concrete, engineering of the structure of  the formwork is often required."

							"text":"When concrete is in its wet state,  great care is required in assembling the formwork to prevent leaks  and failures. The water-to-cement ratio must be managed and  checked to ensure correct mixture. Concrete is a heavy material.  During the curing process, engineered shoring for formwork is  required. Once concrete has cured, it is quite labor intensive to  correct errors. Concrete is tremendously energy consumptive and  produces CO2  gas emissions in its production process. In spite  of this, concrete walls are durable and require little maintenance  over time. "

Different metals used for cladding systems include aluminum, steel, lead, copper, leadcoated copper, bronze, stainless steel and titanium. As with all building systems, the evolution of metal cladding has focused on reducing the amount of metal in order to reduce the cost, not only of the cladding itself, but also of the supporting structure. The most common metal cladding assemblies are metal sheet panels and composite panels."

							"title":"BACKUP WALL",
							"text":"A backup wall is a nonstructural wall constructed  on-site that spans from slab to slab. The most typical construc- tion is light-gauge metal studs with insulation between the studs  and a gypsum board, wood or veneered plywood interior finish.  A backup wall also carries and conceals pipework and electrical  services."
						},
						{
							"title":"METAL CLADDING ASSEMBLIES",
							"text":" A flat metal sheet is thin, has no stiff- ness, and therefore requires a continuous supporting substrate  (plywood, etc.). A flat metal sheet that spans without support, is  typically at least 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) thick and therefore is heavier  and requires a more robust support structure. Alternatively, thin  sheet metal can be corrugated to enable it to span. Typically, a  corrugated sheet of 2-3 inches (51-67 mm) deep can span 5-8  feet (1.5-2.4 m). Thin sheet metal panels are typically joined by  interlocking standing or flat seams for flat sheets or overlapping  joints for corrugated sheets."
						},
						{
							"title":"CONSTRUCTION ISSUES SUSTAINABILITY",
							"text":"Metal cladding systems range  from very inexpensive, such as thin steel sheet that is printed with  a texture to simulate wood and vinyl coated, to very expensive,  such as titanium. Less costly systems are entirely factory made,  whereas custom or variable systems typically require a high level  of skilled labor on-site. Metal extraction from the earth typically causes environmen- tal damage, including erosion and pollution of groundwater.  Metal manufacturing has high embodied energy, requiring large  amounts of water and heat; however, transportation of metal clad- ding components to site is not as expensive as concrete or ma- sonry systems because metal cladding is typically much lighter in  weight. Metal cladding does not have any inherent fire resistance  (unlike concrete or masonry cladding for example); therefore, if  fire resistance is required, it must be achieved through a backup  wall."

							"title":"CONSTRUCTION AND SUSTAINABILITY ",
							"text":"The advantages of using  pre-casting include high quality, reduced time on-site and  economy. Factory production, which is independent of weath- er conditions, enables the concrete mix and curing conditions to be highly controlled. Precasting has typically benefited from an  economy of scale, that is, it is most economical when there is a  high degree of repetition of elements. Concrete, after aluminum and steel, has high levels of embod- ied energy and produces CO2  gas emission, both in its manufac- turing and its transport. Concrete is a huge consumer of natural  resources, whose extraction causes environmental degradation  and requires large amounts of water and heat in the process of  manufacturing. These factors can be mitigated by using flyash or  other forms of industrial waste in place of Portland cement or by  using ground up concrete or other durable recycled materials as  aggregate. Reusable formwork also helps to minimize the consid- erable resources needed for concrete construction. Precast cladding units are typically large and very heavy and  therefore are costly to transport. The most sustainable strategy is  to minimize the transportation distance from factory to site. Well- detailed concrete cladding is a long-life material that requires little  maintenance"

							"text":"Stone cladding is expensive relative  to many other materials. The detailing of stone cladding and its  highly specialized fixings is typically done by the stone subcon- tractor, who provides shop drawings for approval by the design  team. Fabrication and installation are carried out by highly skilled  labor. Each piece of stone is prefabricated in a shop and marked  with a code to identify its precise location in the building envelope.  Because stone is robust and durable, it typically requires minimal  protective measures, such as wrapping, either in the shop or on  the building site. Stone has low levels of embodied energy in its manufacture.  Large blocks of stone are quarried and transported to workshops  where the stone is cut and finished. Although water is required  continuously during cutting and finishing to cool the equipment,  the amount of this water is minimal relative to other materials such  as concrete. However, stone quarries disfigure the landscape.  The embodied energy in stone, related to transportation, is signifi- cant because stone is transported globally. In some cases, inter- national shipping and foreign labor add up to less than domestic  labor and transportation by truck. Well-detailed stone cladding is  a long-life material that requires little maintenance."
