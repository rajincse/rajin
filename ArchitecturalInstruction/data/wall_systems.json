                    "description": "A cavity wall consists of two unbonded wythes of masonry separated by an air space. The primary purpose of the cavity is to prevent water from reaching the inner wythe. Cavity walls can be load bearing or nonload-bearing. For load-bearing constructions, the floor and roof loads of the building are carried by the inner wythe. For nonload-bearing assemblies, another primary structure such as steel or concrete carries roofs and floors. The cavity wall carries only its own weight."

The most common association is with fully glazed building envelopes, but curtain walls may also be made of metal, stone, concrete or other materials. Standard glazed curtain wall systems typically use aluminum frames because they are lightweight and strong, can be easily formed into complex shapes by the process of extrusion, and readily accept a wide range of finishes. Glazed curtain wall systems are designed to be glazed either from the outside or the inside."

Different metals used for cladding systems include aluminum, steel, lead, copper, leadcoated copper, bronze, stainless steel and titanium. As with all building systems, the evolution of metal cladding has focused on reducing the amount of metal in order to reduce the cost, not only of the cladding itself, but also of the supporting structure. The most common metal cladding assemblies are metal sheet panels and composite panels."

Precast concrete cladding panel sizes are governed by the 10-12 foot (3.0-3.6 m) width of typical factory casting beds and by the limited dimensions of road, rail or ship transportation from factory to site. Precast concrete cladding can achieve a variety of textures and colors by varying the concrete mix, particularly the aggregate. A wide range of finishes may also be developed through (a) manipulation of the formwork, (b) incorporation of other facing materials such as ceramic tiles, thin bricks or thin stone, either by incorporation in the formwork or application to the surface of the precast panel, and (c) manual manipulation of the surface either during or after the curing process."
